## Project Rationale

Milwaukee is a leading global brand for professional cordless power tools. It is known for innovation, durability, and productivity in markets such as North America and Europe. However, in Vietnam, the brand has not reached the same level of success. The issue lies not in product quality but in brand perception.

The Vietnamese tools and machines market is expanding. In 2025, it is projected to generate US$1.50 billion in revenue, with an annual growth rate of 2.77% through 2029 [(Statista, 2025)](#1). This growth is supported by the country’s push to modernize infrastructure and attract foreign investment, creating strong opportunities for international brands that can build trust and deliver long-term value.

Milwaukee faces three key barriers in this market. Many workers are not aware of the brand. Some mistake it for a Chinese company, which lowers trust. Others see the price as too high compared to competitors. In a price-sensitive environment where peer trust matters, these barriers prevent wider adoption.

This project is designed to address those gaps. Its aim is to reposition Milwaukee as a premium American brand in Vietnam. The focus is on shifting attention from price to long-term value, correcting origin confusion, and strengthening trust among professional users. Achieving this will allow Milwaukee to capture growth, build stronger dealer networks, and secure a leading position in the market.

## Brand and Market Context

Milwaukee is an American company known for advanced cordless power tools used by professionals in construction, Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and electrical work. Globally, the brand is positioned as a premium choice, competing on innovation, safety, and durability [(Milwaukee, 2021)](#2).

In Vietnam, the professional tools market is crowded with well-established brands [(Awasthi, 2024)](#3). Bosch is recognized for German engineering and an extensive dealer network. Makita appeals with Japanese reliability at accessible prices. Dewalt leverages its American heritage and strong reputation in heavy-duty applications. These competitors are better known locally and often perceived as safer choices.

Vietnamese users are highly price sensitive [(Trang et al., 2023)](#4). Many consumers prioritize immediate affordability over long-term durability. Purchase decisions are also shaped by peer recommendations and visible proof of performance, such as tool demonstrations on job sites. In this context, Milwaukee faces two disadvantages: "limited brand familiarity and higher prices compared to local expectations", according to Hoang Thai, Product Brand Manager at Milwaukee Vietnam.

Compounding the issue, there is confusion about the brand’s origin. Some Vietnamese workers believe Milwaukee is Chinese, which lowers trust and reduces willingness to pay a premium. As a result, Milwaukee struggles to explain the value of its tools and to position itself as a credible premium option.

## Product Portfolio

Milwaukee offers a broad ecosystem of professional tools designed for demanding applications. Its portfolio is built around cordless systems that emphasize power, safety, and productivity.

The [M18™ System](#m18) is Milwaukee’s flagship 18V platform. It delivers heavy-duty performance for construction, electrical, and mechanical work. With hundreds of compatible tools powered by the same battery platform, it provides long-term value for professional users who invest in the ecosystem [(Figure 1)](#m18).

The [M12™ System](#m12) targets compact and portable applications. These 12V tools are designed for tight spaces, service work, and trades that require lightweight solutions without compromising on performance [(Figure 2)](#m12).

The [MX FUEL™ System](#mx) extends Milwaukee’s innovation to light equipment. It replaces petrol-powered solutions with battery technology, offering safer, cleaner, and quieter operation on job sites [(Figure 3)](#mx).

Alongside these platforms, Milwaukee also provides a wide range of hand tools, accessories, and storage solutions. These products reinforce the brand’s ecosystem strategy, where professionals can depend on Milwaukee across multiple categories.

## Problem Statement

Although Milwaukee has a strong global reputation, its performance in Vietnam is constrained by perception gaps rather than product limitations. According to Jane Pham, Commericial Director, there are three key issues:

1. **Low brand awareness**: Many Vietnamese professionals are unfamiliar with Milwaukee compared to competitors such as Bosch, Makita, and Dewalt. This reduces consideration during the purchase process.

2. **Price–value gap**: Milwaukee tools are often viewed as expensive relative to local expectations. In a highly price-sensitive market, consumers focus on upfront costs rather than long-term durability and productivity gains.

3. **Origin misperception**: Some workers mistakenly believe Milwaukee is a Chinese brand. This weakens trust and undermines the brand’s American heritage, which is central to its premium positioning.

These challenges are perception-driven and directly limit adoption, dealer confidence, and ecosystem growth. Without addressing them, Milwaukee risks losing relevance in Vietnam’s expanding professional tools market.

## Objectives and Scope

This project aims to reposition Milwaukee as the leading premium American tool brand in Vietnam by addressing key perception barriers. The objectives are framed around three strategic pillars:

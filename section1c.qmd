- Improving grammar, clarity, and readability.
- Providing suggestions on tone and style to ensure accessibility.

AI was not used to generate research data, synthesize original content, or create analysis and recommendations. All findings, insights, and strategic proposals are the result of the authors’ own research, supported by market data, interviews, and academic frameworks.

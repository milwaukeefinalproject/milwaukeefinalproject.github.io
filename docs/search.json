Persona 1\n\n\nDemographic\n\nMale, 32 years old\nBased in Bình Dương industrial zones\nMid-income, self-employed or part of 3–10 man contractor teams\n\nPsychographics\n\nTakes pride in skill, reputation, and tools\nValues reliability, power, and long-term investment\nSkeptical of “trendy” brands; prefers peer recommendations\nPrice-sensitive but willing to pay if ROI is clear\n\nBehavioral Traits\n\nResearches tools via YouTube, Facebook groups, and in-store demos\nFollows technicians and repair channels on social media\nResponds well to live demos and word-of-mouth from coworkers\nWaits for promotions or bundle offers before purchasing\n\nPain Points\n\nFrustrated by short-lifespan tools and frequent breakdowns\nDislikes heavy, noisy, or overheating equipment\nDistrusts brand claims — insists on testing tools firsthand\n\nWhat Converts Him\n\nSeeing performance live (demo competitions, trials)\nTrusting authentic peer stories over advertisements\nSmart trade-in programs and bundle offers\nProof of long-term savings (less downtime, less fuel cost, fewer repairs)\n\nPersona 2 – Mr. Tập, The Retail Gatekeeper\n\n\n\nFigure 6.

He is the professional who must experience and validate “Red Power” before committing. Mr. Tập represents the secondary push audience. He is the retail decision-maker who ensures Milwaukee is recommended and available at point-of-sale. By targeting both personas in parallel, Milwaukee can close the loop between awareness, trial, and conversion in Vietnam."

Key trades such as HVAC, Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing systems (MEP), and civil works are becoming more professionalized, which creates strong demand for cordless technologies.\nMarket size and growth\n\nPower tools market value: USD 1.3 billion in 2023 (Awasthi, 2024).\nTools & Machines market: USD 1.50 billion projected for 2025, with 2.77% CAGR (2025–2029) (Statista, 2025).\nConstruction sector: from USD 74.81 billion in 2025 to USD 110.42 billion in 2030 (8.1% CAGR) (Mordor Intelligence, 2025).\nEquipment volumes: 6.12k units in 2023 → 7.90k units by 2029 (4.35% CAGR) (Arizton, 2025).\n\nDemand drivers\n\nUrbanization and infrastructure projects expanding across major cities (Tuan & Lan, 2025).\nSafety and compliance concerns encouraging cordless adoption in indoor environments (Phan & Zhou, 2023).\nMobility and productivity needs, as trades increasingly require lighter tools for tighter spaces.\n\nAdoption realities\n\nPrice sensitivity remains high, with many buyers focused on upfront cost rather than lifetime value (Trang et al., 2023).\nLegacy preferences for corded and gasoline tools persist, as they are associated with reliability and raw power.\nPurchase decisions rely on proof, in which contractors trust peer recommendations and want to test tools directly on job sites.\n\nImplications for Milwaukee\nThe Vietnamese market is large enough to support a premium, cordless-led positioning.

According to Jane Pham, Commericial Director, the main competitors are Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt, each with distinct strengths (Table 3).\n\nTable 3.

However, its durability is only rated low-to-mid, suggesting Milwaukee can differentiate on performance and reliability rather than competing head-to-head on visibility alone.\nMakita maintains moderate awareness and is widely available at affordable prices. Its durability is also rated low-to-mid, which positions it as the budget-friendly choice. For Milwaukee, this highlights an opportunity to frame its premium positioning as a value-for-money investment rather than a simple cost comparison.\nDeWalt overlaps Milwaukee’s American brand heritage and mid-to-premium pricing but suffers from limited distribution and only mid-level durability. This reduces its competitive threat, though it also means Milwaukee cannot rely on “American origin” alone to stand out, it must prove superior value through innovation and community building.\nMilwaukee is uniquely positioned: it has the highest durability and an advanced ecosystem (M18, M12, MX FUEL), but its low awareness and selective distribution restrict reach. Its challenge is not product quality but market perception and accessibility. Success will depend on boosting visibility, demonstrating long-term value through trials, and educating users on its ecosystem benefits."

    "section": "Insights from Semi-Structured Interviews",
    "text": "Insights from Semi-Structured Interviews\nTo complement secondary data, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five Milwaukee Vietnam managers between 1 April and 11 April 2025. The participants included:\n\nMs Jane Pham - Commercial Director (thibaouyen.pham@ttigroup.com)\nMr. Minh Pham - South Region Manager (ngocminh.pham@ttigroup.com)\nMrs. Ruby Tran - North Region Manager (thiminhngoc.tran@ttigroup.com)\nMr. Hoang Thai - Product Brand Manager (minhhoang.thai@ttigroup.com)\nMr. David Lam - Assistant Marketing Manager (phangiauy.lam@ttigroup.com)\n\nThe interviews were conducted in person, transcribed into text, and coded using NVivo software. The analysis followed an action research methodology, where insights from internal stakeholders were used to diagnose current challenges and shape practical solutions. Transcripts were also processed in RStudio to identify recurring keywords and sentiment clusters, ensuring reliability in theme generation.\nInterview guide\nThe semi-structured format allowed flexibility while focusing on five core questions:\n\nHow do Vietnamese professionals currently perceive Milwaukee compared to competitors?\nWhat are the main barriers to adoption of cordless tools in Vietnam?\nHow do customers react to Milwaukee’s pricing relative to Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt?\nWhat role do promotions, demos, or peer recommendations play in the purchase decision?\nFrom your perspective, what changes are most critical for Milwaukee to build stronger brand equity?\n\nKey themes From the coding process, three dominant themes emerged. These themes directly support the development of the perceptual maps in the following subsection.\n\nTheme 1: Awareness Gap: Managers consistently highlighted Milwaukee’s limited brand recognition outside trade circles. Many customers confuse Milwaukee with other brands or assume it has a foreign origin unrelated to the U.S. This theme will later be illustrated in a perceptual map that shows Milwaukee positioned as low in awareness despite its strong reputation globally.\nTheme 2: Price–Value Tension: While professionals acknowledged Milwaukee’s superior durability and ecosystem, they perceived its tools as significantly more expensive than alternatives. Managers noted that most purchases occur only during promotions, which reinforces a transactional mindset. This theme will later be visualized in a perceptual map where Milwaukee appears as highly durable but also the most expensive brand.\nTheme 3: Proof and Experience: A recurring insight was that contractors trust tools only after direct demonstration or peer validation. Without hands-on proof, many rely on upfront price comparisons rather than long-term return on investment (ROI). This theme will later be reflected in the perceptual maps, emphasizing the critical role of trial and social proof in shifting perceptions.\n\nImplication The interviews confirm that Milwaukee’s barriers are perception-based rather than product-based. High durability and innovation are recognized internally but remain under-communicated to the wider market. Addressing awareness, price sensitivity, and proof of performance will be essential to reposition Milwaukee in Vietnam."

    "title": "Situation Analysis",
    "section": "Perceptual Maps",
    "text": "Perceptual Maps\nTo synthesize secondary data and insights from semi-structured interviews, three perceptual maps were developed. These maps illustrate how Vietnamese professionals perceive Milwaukee compared to Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt.\nPerceptual map 1: Durability vs. Price\nMilwaukee is positioned in the quadrant of high durability and high price. Professionals recognize its superior tool performance, but the premium cost creates hesitation in a price-sensitive market. DeWalt occupies a similar premium zone, though with slightly lower durability perceptions. Bosch and Makita are seen as more affordable, but also less durable. The key challenge for Milwaukee is to shift perceptions from “expensive” to “worth the investment,” highlighting long-term value and lifetime ROI.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptual map 2: Awareness vs. Perceived Value\nMilwaukee appears as a low-awareness but high-value brand. Those who know and use Milwaukee appreciate its quality, but the majority of consumers remain unfamiliar with it. Bosch dominates with both high awareness despite moderate perceived value, while Makita and DeWalt benefit from better recognition but weaker value perceptions. For Milwaukee, this underscores the need to build visibility while maintaining its credibility as a high-value brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptual map 3: Push vs. Resistance\nThis map reflects customer behavior in terms of marketing push (promotions, activations) versus purchase resistance. Milwaukee is situated in the moderate push, high resistance quadrant, indicating that despite strong promotional activity, customers hesitate to commit without deeper proof of performance. DeWalt faces similar push but with less resistance, while Bosch benefits from strong distribution and lower resistance. Conversely, Makita faces less resistance due to its affordability. For Milwaukee, the insight is clear: promotional pushes alone are insufficient; hence, adoption requires trust built through demonstrations, peer validation, and product education.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic takeaway\nAcross all three maps, Milwaukee consistently emerges as a brand with respected durability and innovation, but constrained by low awareness, perceived expensiveness, and high customer resistance. To reposition successfully in Vietnam, Milwaukee must:\n\nBuild brand exposure and correct origin confusion.\nReframe its premium price through clear lifetime-value narratives.\nReduce resistance by enabling trials, demos, and peer advocacy."

    "section": "Key barriers",
    "text": "Key barriers\nAll five managers in Milwaukee Vietnam consistently articulate consumer needs in simple terms:\n\nJob-to-be-done\n“When I’m on-site and under time pressure, I want a tool that’s safe, reliable, and easy to carry, so I can finish the job quickly without worrying about breakdowns or hazards.”\n\nThe Job-to-be-Done highlights that users in Vietnam seek tools that are safe, reliable, and easy to use under time pressure. While Milwaukee has the product quality to deliver on these needs, several barriers limit its ability to scale in Vietnam. These barriers are not technical but perception- and structure-driven.\nMarket Barriers\n\nUpfront price sensitivity: Battery-powered tools are perceived as costly, with customers focusing on initial purchase price rather than lifetime value.\nLegacy tool habits: Many tradespeople remain loyal to corded or gasoline-powered tools, which they still associate with power and reliability.\n\nKnowledge Barriers\n\nLimited product education: Key advantages of Milwaukee’s M12™ and M18™ platforms, including safety features and long-term savings, are not widely understood.\nBrand origin confusion: Some users mistakenly believe Milwaukee is not truly American, which undermines trust in its premium positioning.\n\nAccess Barriers\n\nDistribution gaps: Milwaukee has selective distribution and limited presence in traditional tool retailers, modern trade channels, and popular e-commerce platforms.\nPromotion dependency: With 82% of sales driven by discounts, full-price purchases remain rare, reinforcing a transactional purchase cycle.\n\nImplication\nThese barriers explain why Milwaukee is consistently perceived as durable but expensive, valuable but under-recognized, and promoted heavily yet resisted at the point of purchase. Addressing them will be central to repositioning the brand and aligning it more closely with the needs expressed in the Job-to-be-Done.\n\n\nReferences\n\nArizton. (2025).

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo and RStudio. Thematic coding identified recurring issues around brand awareness, price sensitivity, and misperceptions of origin, which informed the construction of three perceptual maps.\nSecondary research included industry reports (Statista, Ken Research, Arizton, Mordor Intelligence) and competitor benchmarking. These sources provided quantitative data on market size, growth trends, and purchasing behaviors.\nFindings from both streams were integrated using frameworks such as PESTEL analysis, Job-to-Be-Done (JTBD), perceptual mapping, and the Ansoff Matrix.

    "text": "Milwaukee is a leading global brand for professional cordless power tools. It is known for innovation, durability, and productivity in markets such as North America and Europe. However, in Vietnam, the brand has not reached the same level of success. “The issue lies not in product quality but in brand perception.”, according to David Lam, Assistant Marketing Manager at Milwaukee Vietnam.\nThe Vietnamese tools and machines market is expanding.

    "section": "Brand and Market Context",
    "text": "Brand and Market Context\nMilwaukee is an American company known for advanced cordless power tools used by professionals in construction, Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and electrical work. Globally, the brand is positioned as a premium choice, competing on innovation, safety, and durability (Milwaukee, 2021).\nIn Vietnam, the professional tools market is crowded with well-established brands (Awasthi, 2024). Bosch is recognized for German engineering and an extensive dealer network. Makita appeals with Japanese reliability at accessible prices. Dewalt leverages its American heritage and strong reputation in heavy-duty applications. These competitors are better known locally and often perceived as safer choices.\nVietnamese users are highly price sensitive (Trang et al., 2023). Many consumers prioritize immediate affordability over long-term durability. Purchase decisions are also shaped by peer recommendations and visible proof of performance, such as tool demonstrations on job sites. In this context, Milwaukee faces two disadvantages: “limited brand familiarity and higher prices compared to local expectations”, according to Hoang Thai, Product Brand Manager at Milwaukee Vietnam.\nCompounding the issue, there is confusion about the brand’s origin. Some Vietnamese workers believe Milwaukee is Chinese, which lowers trust and reduces willingness to pay a premium. As a result, Milwaukee struggles to explain the value of its tools and to position itself as a credible premium option."

    "section": "Problem Statement",
    "text": "Problem Statement\nAlthough Milwaukee has a strong global reputation, its performance in Vietnam is constrained by perception gaps rather than product limitations. According to Jane Pham, Commericial Director at Milwaukee Vietnam, there are three key issues:\n\nLow brand awareness: Many Vietnamese professionals are unfamiliar with Milwaukee compared to competitors such as Bosch, Makita, and Dewalt. This reduces consideration during the purchase process.\nPrice–value gap: Milwaukee tools are often viewed as expensive relative to local expectations. In a highly price-sensitive market, consumers focus on upfront costs rather than long-term durability and productivity gains.\nOrigin misperception: Some workers mistakenly believe Milwaukee is a Chinese brand. This weakens trust and undermines the brand’s American heritage, which is central to its premium positioning.\n\nThese challenges are perception-driven and directly limit adoption, dealer confidence, and ecosystem growth. Without addressing them, Milwaukee risks losing relevance in Vietnam’s expanding professional tools market."

The core brand message is illustrated as below:\n\nMilwaukee: RedPower\nSuperior Technology - The Professional’s Partner\n\nThis message combines two pillars:\n\n“Superior Technology” → communicates advanced engineering, durability, and innovation without over-relying on “American heritage” wording.\n“The Professional’s Partner” → anthropomorphizes the brand, positioning Milwaukee as a trusted companion for professionals rather than just a tool supplier.\n\nMilwaukee aims to position itself in Vietnam as a high-performance cordless tool brand, trusted by professionals and rooted in American engineering excellence.

    "text": "Over the past five years, Milwaukee has entered the Vietnamese market with a strong global reputation and a portfolio of high-performance cordless tools. However, despite clear functional advantages, like safety, portability, and long-term cost savings, the brand is still struggling to gain traction locally. The biggest issue is not the product, but it is perception.\nThis project dives into the core barriers preventing Milwaukee from scaling in Vietnam: limited brand awareness, pricing objections, and a critical misperception as many people still think it’s a Chinese brand, not an American one. That misalignment between what the brand is and how it’s seen is what this project aims to address.\nBy combining market research, competitive analysis, and insight into how Vietnamese professionals choose their tools, we have built a communication strategy that reframes Milwaukee for what it truly is: a premium American technology brand made for serious professionals. The strategy focuses on clarifying its value, reconnecting with its origin story, and choosing the right messages, channels, and touchpoints to reach the right people, especially those in HVAC and electrical sectors.\nWhat follows is not just a branding proposal, but a practical roadmap for repositioning Milwaukee in a market where trust, function, and perceived value matter more than ever.\nasdasdad"

However, in Vietnam, the brand has not grown as expected. This is not because of product problems, but because of how people see the brand. Many Vietnamese workers are not familiar with Milwaukee, or they think it is a Chinese brand. Also, some believe the tools are too expensive. In a market where price and trust are important, this makes it difficult for Milwaukee to compete. This project was developed to help the brand improve its image and attract more users in Vietnam."

    "text": "Brand and market context\nMilwaukee is an American company known for advanced cordless tools used in industries like construction, HVAC, and electrical work. In Vietnam, the tool market is already very competitive. Brands like Bosch, Makita, and Dewalt are better known and trusted by local users. Vietnamese workers often care about cost and will choose tools that seem more affordable, even if they are lower in quality. Also, there is confusion about Milwaukee’s origin. Some people think it is Chinese, which lowers trust. This makes it harder for the brand to explain why its tools are worth the higher price."

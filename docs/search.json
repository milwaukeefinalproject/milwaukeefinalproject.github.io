According to Jane Pham, Commericial Director, the main competitors are Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt, each with distinct strengths (Table 3).\n\nTable 3. Competitive landscape for major power tool brands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\nAwareness\nPrice positioning\nDurability\nDistribution\nStrategic strengths\n\n\n\n\nBosch\nHigh\nMid-to-premium\nLow-to-mid\nExtensive offline & online dealer network\nStrong visibility, trusted German engineering\n\n\nMakita\nModerate\nLow-to-mid\nLow-to-mid\nSolid nationwide distribution\nKnown for accessibility and versatile product range\n\n\nDeWalt\nModerate\nMid-to-premium\nmid\nLimited distribution footprint\nAmerican heritage; overlaps with Milwaukee but weaker presence\n\n\nMilwaukee\nLow\nPremium\nHigh\nSelective distribution; early penetration stage\nEcosystem strength (M18, M12, MX FUEL)\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Implications\nBosch benefits from high awareness and a strong distribution network, making it the most visible competitor. However, its durability is only rated low-to-mid, suggesting Milwaukee can differentiate on performance and reliability rather than competing head-to-head on visibility alone.\nMakita maintains moderate awareness and is widely available at affordable prices. Its durability is also rated low-to-mid, which positions it as the budget-friendly choice. For Milwaukee, this highlights an opportunity to frame its premium positioning as a value-for-money investment rather than a simple cost comparison.\nDeWalt overlaps Milwaukee’s American brand heritage and mid-to-premium pricing but suffers from limited distribution and only mid-level durability. This reduces its competitive threat, though it also means Milwaukee cannot rely on “American origin” alone to stand out, it must prove superior value through innovation and community building.\nMilwaukee is uniquely positioned: it has the highest durability and an advanced ecosystem (M18, M12, MX FUEL), but its low awareness and selective distribution restrict reach. Its challenge is not product quality but market perception and accessibility. Success will depend on boosting visibility, demonstrating long-term value through trials, and educating users on its ecosystem benefits."

    "section": "Insights from Semi-Structured Interviews",
    "text": "Insights from Semi-Structured Interviews\nTo complement secondary data, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five Milwaukee Vietnam managers between 1 April and 11 April 2025. The participants included:\n\nMs Jane Pham - Commercial Director (thibaouyen.pham@ttigroup.com.vn)\nMr. Minh Pham - South Region Manager (ngocminh.pham@ttigroup.com.vn)\nMrs. Ruby Tran - North Region Manager (thiminhngoc.tran@ttigroup.com.vn)\nMr. Hoang Thai - Product Brand Manager (minhhoang.thai@ttigroup.com.vn)\nMr. David Lam - Assistant Marketing Manager (phangiauy.lam@ttigroup.com.vn)\n\nThe interviews were conducted in person, transcribed into text, and coded using NVivo software. The analysis followed an action research methodology, where insights from internal stakeholders were used to diagnose current challenges and shape practical solutions. Transcripts were also processed in RStudio to identify recurring keywords and sentiment clusters, ensuring reliability in theme generation.\nInterview guide\nThe semi-structured format allowed flexibility while focusing on five core questions:\n\nHow do Vietnamese professionals currently perceive Milwaukee compared to competitors?\nWhat are the main barriers to adoption of cordless tools in Vietnam?\nHow do customers react to Milwaukee’s pricing relative to Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt?\nWhat role do promotions, demos, or peer recommendations play in the purchase decision?\nFrom your perspective, what changes are most critical for Milwaukee to build stronger brand equity?\n\nKey themes From the coding process, three dominant themes emerged. These themes directly support the development of the perceptual maps in the following subsection.\n\nTheme 1: Awareness Gap: Managers consistently highlighted Milwaukee’s limited brand recognition outside trade circles. Many customers confuse Milwaukee with other brands or assume it has a foreign origin unrelated to the U.S. This theme will later be illustrated in a perceptual map that shows Milwaukee positioned as low in awareness despite its strong reputation globally.\nTheme 2: Price–Value Tension: While professionals acknowledged Milwaukee’s superior durability and ecosystem, they perceived its tools as significantly more expensive than alternatives. Managers noted that most purchases occur only during promotions, which reinforces a transactional mindset. This theme will later be visualized in a perceptual map where Milwaukee appears as highly durable but also the most expensive brand.\nTheme 3: Proof and Experience: A recurring insight was that contractors trust tools only after direct demonstration or peer validation. Without hands-on proof, many rely on upfront price comparisons rather than long-term Return on investment (ROI). This theme will later be reflected in the perceptual maps, emphasizing the critical role of trial and social proof in shifting perceptions.\n\nImplication The interviews confirm that Milwaukee’s barriers are perception-based rather than product-based. High durability and innovation are recognized internally but remain under-communicated to the wider market. Addressing awareness, price sensitivity, and proof of performance will be essential to reposition Milwaukee in Vietnam."

    "section": "Perceptual Maps",
    "text": "Perceptual Maps\nTo synthesize secondary data and insights from semi-structured interviews, three perceptual maps were developed. These maps illustrate how Vietnamese professionals perceive Milwaukee compared to Bosch, Makita, and DeWalt.\nPerceptual map 1: Durability vs. Price\nMilwaukee is positioned in the quadrant of high durability and high price. Professionals recognize its superior tool performance, but the premium cost creates hesitation in a price-sensitive market. DeWalt occupies a similar premium zone, though with slightly lower durability perceptions. Bosch and Makita are seen as more affordable, but also less durable. The key challenge for Milwaukee is to shift perceptions from “expensive” to “worth the investment,” highlighting long-term value and lifetime ROI.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptual map 2: Awareness vs. Perceived Value\nMilwaukee appears as a low-awareness but high-value brand. Those who know and use Milwaukee appreciate its quality, but the majority of consumers remain unfamiliar with it. Bosch dominates with both high awareness despite moderate perceived value, while Makita and DeWalt benefit from better recognition but weaker value perceptions. For Milwaukee, this underscores the need to build visibility while maintaining its credibility as a high-value brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptual map 3: Push vs. Resistance\nThis map reflects customer behavior in terms of marketing push (promotions, activations) versus purchase resistance. Milwaukee is situated in the moderate push, high resistance quadrant, indicating that despite strong promotional activity, customers hesitate to commit without deeper proof of performance. DeWalt faces similar push but with less resistance, while Bosch benefits from strong distribution and lower resistance. Conversely, Makita faces less resistance due to its affordability. For Milwaukee, the insight is clear: promotional pushes alone are insufficient; hence, adoption requires trust built through demonstrations, peer validation, and product education.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic takeaway\nAcross all three maps, Milwaukee consistently emerges as a brand with respected durability and innovation, but constrained by low awareness, perceived expensiveness, and high customer resistance. To reposition successfully in Vietnam, Milwaukee must:\n\nBuild brand exposure and correct origin confusion.\nReframe its premium price through clear lifetime-value narratives.\nReduce resistance by enabling trials, demos, and peer advocacy."

    "text": "Key barriers\nAll five managers in Milwaukee Vietnam consistently articulate consumer needs in simple terms:\n\nJob-to-be-done\n“When I’m on-site and under time pressure, I want a tool that’s safe, reliable, and easy to carry, so I can finish the job quickly without worrying about breakdowns or hazards.”\n\nThe Job-to-be-Done highlights that users in Vietnam seek tools that are safe, reliable, and easy to use under time pressure. While Milwaukee has the product quality to deliver on these needs, several barriers limit its ability to scale in Vietnam. These barriers are not technical but perception- and structure-driven.\nMarket Barriers\n\nUpfront price sensitivity: Battery-powered tools are perceived as costly, with customers focusing on initial purchase price rather than lifetime value.\nLegacy tool habits: Many tradespeople remain loyal to corded or gasoline-powered tools, which they still associate with power and reliability.\n\nKnowledge Barriers\n\nLimited product education: Key advantages of Milwaukee’s M12™ and M18™ platforms, including safety features and long-term savings, are not widely understood.\nBrand origin confusion: Some users mistakenly believe Milwaukee is not truly American, which undermines trust in its premium positioning.\n\nAccess Barriers\n\nDistribution gaps: Milwaukee has selective distribution and limited presence in traditional tool retailers, modern trade channels, and popular e-commerce platforms.\nPromotion dependency: With 82% of sales driven by discounts, full-price purchases remain rare, reinforcing a transactional purchase cycle.\n\nImplication\nThese barriers explain why Milwaukee is consistently perceived as durable but expensive, valuable but under-recognized, and promoted heavily yet resisted at the point of purchase. Addressing them will be central to repositioning the brand and aligning it more closely with the needs expressed in the Job-to-be-Done.\n\n\nReferences\n\nArizton. (2025).

    "text": "Over the past five years, Milwaukee has entered the Vietnamese market with a strong global reputation and a portfolio of high-performance cordless tools. However, despite clear functional advantages, like safety, portability, and long-term cost savings, the brand is still struggling to gain traction locally. The biggest issue is not the product, but perception.\nThis project dives into the core barriers preventing Milwaukee from scaling in Vietnam: limited brand awareness, pricing objections, and a critical misperception as many people still think it’s a Chinese brand, not an American one. That misalignment between what the brand is and how it’s seen is what this project aims to address.\nBy combining market research, competitive analysis, and insight into how Vietnamese professionals choose their tools, we have built a communication strategy that reframes Milwaukee for what it truly is: a premium American technology brand made for serious professionals. The strategy focuses on clarifying its value, reconnecting with its origin story, and choosing the right messages, channels, and touchpoints to reach the right people, especially those in HVAC and electrical sectors.\nWhat follows is not just a branding proposal, but a practical roadmap for repositioning Milwaukee in a market where trust, function, and perceived value matter more than ever."

However, in Vietnam, the brand has not reached the same level of success. The issue lies not in product quality but in brand perception.\nThe Vietnamese tools and machines market is expanding. In 2025, it is projected to generate US$1.50 billion in revenue, with an annual growth rate of 2.77% through 2029 (Statista, 2025). This growth is supported by the country’s push to modernize infrastructure and attract foreign investment, creating strong opportunities for international brands that can build trust and deliver long-term value.\nMilwaukee faces three key barriers in this market. Many workers are not aware of the brand. Some mistake it for a Chinese company, which lowers trust. Others see the price as too high compared to competitors. In a price-sensitive environment where peer trust matters, these barriers prevent wider adoption.\nThis project is designed to address those gaps. Its aim is to reposition Milwaukee as a premium American brand in Vietnam. The focus is on shifting attention from price to long-term value, correcting origin confusion, and strengthening trust among professional users. Achieving this will allow Milwaukee to capture growth, build stronger dealer networks, and secure a leading position in the market."

This growth is supported by the country’s push to modernize infrastructure and attract foreign investment, creating strong opportunities for international brands that can build trust and deliver long-term value.\nMilwaukee faces three key barriers in this market. Many workers are not aware of the brand. Some mistake it for a Chinese company, which lowers trust. Others see the price as too high compared to competitors. In a price-sensitive environment where peer trust matters, these barriers prevent wider adoption.\nThis project is designed to address those gaps. Its aim is to reposition Milwaukee as a premium American brand in Vietnam. The focus is on shifting attention from price to long-term value, correcting origin confusion, and strengthening trust among professional users. Achieving this will allow Milwaukee to capture growth, build stronger dealer networks, and secure a leading position in the market."

    "text": "Brand and Market Context\nMilwaukee is an American company known for advanced cordless power tools used by professionals in construction, Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and electrical work. Globally, the brand is positioned as a premium choice, competing on innovation, safety, and durability (Milwaukee, 2021).\nIn Vietnam, the professional tools market is crowded with well-established brands (Awasthi, 2024). Bosch is recognized for German engineering and an extensive dealer network. Makita appeals with Japanese reliability at accessible prices. Dewalt leverages its American heritage and strong reputation in heavy-duty applications. These competitors are better known locally and often perceived as safer choices.\nVietnamese users are highly price sensitive (Trang et al., 2023). Many consumers prioritize immediate affordability over long-term durability. Purchase decisions are also shaped by peer recommendations and visible proof of performance, such as tool demonstrations on job sites. In this context, Milwaukee faces two disadvantages: “limited brand familiarity and higher prices compared to local expectations”, according to Hoang Thai, Product Brand Manager at Milwaukee Vietnam.\nCompounding the issue, there is confusion about the brand’s origin. Some Vietnamese workers believe Milwaukee is Chinese, which lowers trust and reduces willingness to pay a premium. As a result, Milwaukee struggles to explain the value of its tools and to position itself as a credible premium option."

Its portfolio is built around cordless systems that emphasize power, safety, and productivity.\nThe M18™ System is Milwaukee’s flagship 18V platform. It delivers heavy-duty performance for construction, electrical, and mechanical work. With hundreds of compatible tools powered by the same battery platform, it provides long-term value for professional users who invest in the ecosystem (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Milwaukee M18 Platform\n\n\nThe M12™ System targets compact and portable applications. These 12V tools are designed for tight spaces, service work, and trades that require lightweight solutions without compromising on performance (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Milwaukee M12 Platform\n\n\nThe MX FUEL™ System extends Milwaukee’s innovation to light equipment. It replaces petrol-powered solutions with battery technology, offering safer, cleaner, and quieter operation on job sites (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "section": "Problem Statement",
    "text": "Problem Statement\nAlthough Milwaukee has a strong global reputation, its performance in Vietnam is constrained by perception gaps rather than product limitations. According to Jane Pham, Commericial Director, there are three key issues:\n\nLow brand awareness: Many Vietnamese professionals are unfamiliar with Milwaukee compared to competitors such as Bosch, Makita, and Dewalt. This reduces consideration during the purchase process.\nPrice–value gap: Milwaukee tools are often viewed as expensive relative to local expectations. In a highly price-sensitive market, consumers focus on upfront costs rather than long-term durability and productivity gains.\nOrigin misperception: Some workers mistakenly believe Milwaukee is a Chinese brand. This weakens trust and undermines the brand’s American heritage, which is central to its premium positioning.\n\nThese challenges are perception-driven and directly limit adoption, dealer confidence, and ecosystem growth. Without addressing them, Milwaukee risks losing relevance in Vietnam’s expanding professional tools market."

Superior Technology, The Professional’s Partner\n\nThis message combines two pillars:\n\n“Superior Technology” → communicates advanced engineering, durability, and innovation without over-relying on “American heritage” wording.\n“The Professional’s Partner” → anthropomorphize the brand, positioning Milwaukee as a trusted companion for professionals rather than just a tool supplier.\n\nMilwaukee aims to position itself in Vietnam as a high-performance cordless tool brand, trusted by professionals and rooted in American engineering excellence. The revised brand message reflects both its global legacy and local relevance. We applied the Benefit Ladder framework as Table 5 below:\n\nTable 5.

Table 6 represents the summary of current communication channels.\n\nTable 6. Channel Mix Overview for Milwaukee Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nKey Channels\nExecution Focus\n\n\n\n\nBrand Truth\n• Digital platforms (Facebook, YouTube, Zalo)  • PR & trade press  • In-store visibility (POS, displays)\n• Awareness campaigns highlighting durability, safety, and U.S. heritage  • Educational content (videos, infographics) explaining M12™/M18™ ecosystems  • Dealer training to reinforce brand story\n\n\nProof in Action\n• Roadshows & demo vans  • Trade-in activations at retail points  • Partnerships with contractors & training centers\n• Hands-on demo experiences (“Try Before You Buy”)  • Incentives for first-time users (discounts, bundle kits)  • Tool trade-in programs to lower entry barrier\n\n\nCommunity Power\n• Social media UGC campaigns  • Peer influencer/KOC programs  • Loyalty clubs & referral programs\n• Collect and amplify authentic user stories  • Encourage contractors to share job-site content  • Recognition programs for loyal users (Milwaukee Pro Club)\n\n\n\n\nIMC Integration Principles While the channel mix is structured around Milwaukee’s three strategic pillars, channels must also work together along the customer journey. (Table 7) maps key channels to funnel stages, showing how Milwaukee can move professionals from awareness to advocacy.\n\nConsistency of Core Message → “RedPower. Superior Technology, The Professional’s Partner” will be embedded across all touchpoints, ensuring unified positioning.\nChannel Synergy → Digital creates awareness, demos drive adoption, and community advocacy sustains loyalty. Each channel reinforces the others rather than operating in isolation.\nPush–Pull Balance → Retail partners are incentivized to push Milwaukee, while end-users are pulled through awareness, trial, and peer validation.\nLocalization → Content and activations are tailored to Vietnam’s cultural context (e.g., peer influence, high value on safety and productivity, discount-driven trial behaviors).\n\n\nTable 7.

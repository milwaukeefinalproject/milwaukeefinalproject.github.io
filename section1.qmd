Over the past five years, Milwaukee has entered the Vietnamese market with a strong global reputation and a portfolio of high-performance cordless tools. However, despite clear functional advantages, like safety, portability, and long-term cost savings, the brand is still struggling to gain traction locally. The biggest issue is not the product, but perception.

This project dives into the core barriers preventing Milwaukee from scaling in Vietnam: limited brand awareness, pricing objections, and a critical misperception as many people still think it’s a Chinese brand, not an American one. That misalignment between what the brand is and how it’s seen is what this project aims to address.

By combining market research, competitive analysis, and insight into how Vietnamese professionals choose their tools, we have built a communication strategy that reframes Milwaukee for what it truly is: a premium American technology brand made for serious professionals. The strategy focuses on clarifying its value, reconnecting with its origin story, and choosing the right messages, channels, and touchpoints to reach the right people, especially those in HVAC and electrical sectors.

What follows is not just a branding proposal, but a practical roadmap for repositioning Milwaukee in a market where trust, function, and perceived value matter more than ever.
